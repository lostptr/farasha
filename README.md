# Farasha

Farasha is an online library for the [Unofficial Hollow Knight TTRPG](https://hkrpg-team.itch.io/hollow-knight-rpg). You will be able to quickly search for Traits, Weapon Arts, Arcana, Charms and other items used in the game.

You can use it online on [https://lostptr.github.io/farasha/](https://lostptr.github.io/farasha/).

> If you want to make a character sheet online, use [The Hound's Character Manager](https://horodrigo.github.io/bug_character_web/).
